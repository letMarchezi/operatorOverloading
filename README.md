# operatorOverloading
<span style="color:green;"> Overload operators example in C++: operations between rational numbers</span>

In this project was implemented a class named _Racional_(Rational) composed of two integers: _numerador_(numerator) and _denominador_(denominator). Then there are a few operators that are overloaded so the algorithm can calculte additions, subtractions, multiplications and divisions between rational numbers. Futhermore, some relational operatores are also overloaded.


Mathematical operations:
addition +, 
subtraction -, 
multiplication *,
divisions /.

Relational operators:
Greater than >, 
Greater than or Equal to >=, 
Less Than <, 
Less Than or Equal to <=, 
Equal to ==, 
Not Equal to !=.
